# BDCC-Hoang-Electric-System

This project was done as part of the Big Data and Cloud Computing (BDCC) Tech Apprenticeship from 2022-2023. This project aims to be a management system using electric bills.

It is a Role Based Access Control System (RBAC), splitting roles between customers, employees, and admins. Customers have limited viewing power and pay their bills. Employees can manage customers' bills, while admins have employee privelege while also being able to adjust access to the system, such as new employees.

It is a Python Flask application hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and uses RDS for its database. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its frontend.
